			"reward" : "VINEYARD ULTIMATE VACATION LEVEL - This is the big one. This is the trip of a lifetime! Pledge $9,950 or more and receive an all expenses paid 3 day / 2 night trip to Colorado Wine Country for you and one friend! You will get to stay at a bed and breakfast, and will be escorted to the various wineries, meaderies, absent distillers - anywhere wine or alcohol related that allows tours. We will design a gameplan of places to attend and tour, however if there are places not on your list you wish to attend we will make sure you get to see them! We will even accompany you on these tours and we can spend the entire weekend discussing Vineyard Valley. You will also get to have a special dinner with the lead designer of Vineyard Valley, and will get to sit and help design something entirely of your choosing - no matter what it is, and we&#39;ll help to make sure it fits within the game. You will also receive everything at the Vineyard Designer level, and your name will appear in the Backer Credits at the Vineyard Ultimate Vacation level. And since there is only one of this tier available - your name will be alone shining bright as the sole person who backed at this level and got these awesome rewards. Now that&#39;s something to brag about!\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 1: You MUST be 21 years of age or older to accept this backer level due to the fact we will be touring wineries!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 2: Even though we have a $35 international shipping fee, if you are from another country the shipping details may end up being higher for this tier depending on the cost of plane tickets to fly you here and back. You will also be entirely responsible for your own passports and any other international travel requirements.",
