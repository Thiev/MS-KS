<p><b>In response to many inquiries, I'm adding an even larger FP tier with an even bigger discount:</b></p><p>     $300 = 600 FPs.</p><p>To purchase additional Founder’s Points. All you need to do is:</p><p>- Decide which Founder’s Points add-on is for you. We have add-ons starting at ten FPs for $10 and one that gives you 70 FPs for $50. No matter which add-on you buy (or even if you don’t), we thank you for your support of our Kickstarter!</p><p>- Press the “Manage Your Pledge” button or, if you haven’t backed this Kickstarter yet, it will read “Back This Project” on our Camelot Unchained Kickstarter page.</p><p>- Increase your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the add-on(s) you wish to purchase.   Please don’t change your current pledge tier unless of course, you also want to change it while you are on this screen. </p><p>- Then add the total of your add-on(s) onto the amount of the tier. While you are free to pledge any additional amount you wish, by purchasing one of the add-ons you will get the volume discount.</p><p>Please note that in order to purchase an add-on you need to have pledged at the $25 and above (since you do need to have a copy of the game to access the in-game store).

<li>A place, which draws its inspiration more from horror movies, H.P. Lovecraft, H.R. Giger than J.R.R. Tolkien. </li>
<li>A place that is literally alive, not just with NPCs but is itself an NPC!
A place literally infused with the Veil, hiding great secrets and lore of past civilizations. </li>
<li>A place where both crafters and warriors must work together to succeed.</li>
<li> A place where players die and become the terrifying monsters that lay within it.  </li>

<li>Maintain an absolute minimum of 30 FPS in battles of up to 500 people</li>
<li>Efficiently prioritize network usage so there's minimal lag on the things that matter</li>
<li>Allow extensive character customization so every player can have uniquely crafted items</li>
<li>Enable dynamic, changeable, and creative player-built structures</li>
</ul><p>Each update from Andrew has highlighted the continued expansion of the engine’s capabilities while maintaining an ultra-high rate of FPS, and we're still making improvements. </p><p>Check out this update from him and see our engine in action:</p><div class="template oembed" contenteditable="false" data-href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWy7q6UnNDQ">

<p><b>An epic Building System</b></p><p>

Our building system is unlike any other found in an RvR MMORPG. It features: </p><ul>
<li>Cell-based construction system. Structures can be built from cells or groups of cells (Prefabs).</li>
<li>Mines are self-contained bubbles contained under the world map with cooperative mining and RvR action. </li>
<li>Players can record their favorite structures in blueprints, which can then be rented, traded and/or sold to other players. </li>
<li>Players build their own realms, including keeps, forts and castles and then defend them. </li>
</ul><p>Camelot Unchained is not a themepark MMORPG built by developers; it is a world that the players themselves build upon the rubble of the old world. We don’t build worlds, you do! </p><p>Here's the first prototype of our building <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/13861848/camelot-unchained/posts/462972" target="_blank">system!</a></p><p>And so much more is yet to come...</p>

<p>City State Entertainment, led by online game pioneer and Mythic Entertainment founder <b>Mark Jacobs</b> and code guru and CSE co-founder <b>Andrew Meggs</b>, needs your support to make the next great Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) for the PC and select tablets (stretch goal dependent). As one of the very early online gaming developers (circa mid-1980s) and the creative driver behind <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i><b>®</b>, Mark has seen online games grow from an unloved, mostly ignored part of the industry to a major driving force. </p><p>Camelot Unchained takes one part classic legends, adds a twisty
little apocalyptic passage, and mixes in a whole batch of creativity to birth
not just another “me and my WoW-clone”, but a unique RvR-focused MMORPG. It is against the
backdrop of an almost unrecognizable world that our game unfolds, and as a
player of Camelot Unchained, you can expect the following:</p>

<p>·Camelot Unchained is a subscription-based, <b>RvR-focused MMORPG</b>. RvR is an acronym
for Realm vs. Realm<b>® </b>(this
term is a registered trademark of Electronic Arts), which we call TriRealm<b>™ </b>for the interaction of the three main realms.</p>

<p>·The game will feature <b>RvR-based leveling tracks</b> for all classes. <b>No PROGRESSION VIA PvE</b> (player vs. environment), loot drops or
other such systems are currently planned. All leveling will come from engaging
in the game’s RvR-based systems, whether by fighting other players, capturing objectives,
and/or crafting objects to help in RvR. There will be NPCs but you cannot use them to level your character.</p>

<p>·You will have the choice of playing any realm
on each of the game’s servers except that you may play only characters from the
same realm on any single server. In other words, <b>one server = one realm</b>. </p>

<p>·Our subscription tiers will be based on players'
individual choices regarding participation, but <b>will be less than the current accepted norm </b>for MMORPGs.</p>

<p>·The game will be developed for <b>PC (Windows) </b>with stretch goals for
other platforms. </p>

<p>·The game will be available in <b>English</b>
with <b>French</b>, <b>German</b> and other languages based on demand.</p>

<p>·The client will be <b>DRM-free </b>and distributed via Torrent.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-edit_url="/projects/13861848/camelot-unchained/assets/494699/edit" data-id="494699">
<figure><img alt="" class="fit" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/494/699/3a32fafd5971b95b2f8020049d5b4721_large.jpg?1365175720"></figure>
</div>
<p>Mark has always called his online games evolutionary with a mix of revolutionary features. Camelot Unchained will draw a lot of inspiration from “old school” games and MMORPGs while also mixing in some new features. In the rush to cash in on the WoW phenomenon, publishers/designers tried to simply “out-WoW WoW”, leading to most MMORPGs becoming more risk-averse, more “casual player”-focused, and overall, less challenging. This produced, among other things, a loss of the pride and sense of accomplishment that came from succeeding in the older, more difficult titles. We're not talking about spawn-camping for 24 hours straight, but rather the sense of pride from succeeding in a challenging game rather than one which hands you everything on a silver platter. In CU, you will have to earn your skills by deeds, and they will increase slowly over time. Magical items will not be found everywhere like road-kill on highways, so gamers won’t feel the pressure to “keep up with the Gandalfs.”</p>

</div>


<p>Mark believes that every great game starts with a great
foundation. The Foundational Principles he and Andrew have been laying out are
more than simple ideas; they are the bedrock for <i>Camelot Unchained</i>. </p>

<p>The current list of principles can be found on our website
(<a href="http://www.camelotunchained.com" target="_blank">www.camelotunchained.com</a>)</p>

</div>


<p>This game is built upon three main pillars of gameplay, RvR,
crafting and housing. These will receive all the development love they need to
be great, and all these systems will be in place when we go LIVE.  Here are some key elements for crafting and
housing:</p>

<p>·<i>Camelot
Unchained </i>features a totally player-driven economy. There
won’t be drops from the NPCs, no redeemable tokens or anything like that.</p>

<p>·There will be a “pure” crafter class with its
own unique leveling track.</p>

<p>·There will be no auction house for
player-created items. Crafters can have their own stores and either sell there
or directly to players in a bazaar-like setting.</p>

<p>·Crafters will be able to build a wide variety
of items, including weapons, armor, siege equipment and more.</p>

<p>·Our housing system will allow players to construct
everything from huts to mines, and to fortify and rebuild massive structures.</p>

<p>·Players will be able to build structures throughout
the world, in both safe and contested areas.</p>

<p>We will go into more detail about these systems, but in the
meantime, for more information about them, please refer to the Foundational Principles on our
website (<a href="http://www.camelotunchained.com" target="_blank">www.camelotunchained.com</a>)</p>

</div>


<p>Camelot Unchained features three distinct realms
(Arthurians, Tuatha Dé Danann and Vikings) as the protagonists in a bold new
vision.</p>

<div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-edit_url="/projects/13861848/camelot-unchained/assets/475394/edit" data-id="475394">

</div>


<p>At launch, each realm will have at least three races, all
with unique powers, abilities and physical appearance. We will reveal some of
these over the next 30 days. In fact, our backers will have the opportunity to
choose one for each realm during development. We'll also create more if we meet certain stretch goals and as the game
evolves. </p>

</div>


<p><i>Camelot Unchained </i>will
feature a selection of classes at launch, with the actual number dependent on
meeting certain stretch goals. We support an extended version of the “Holy
Trinity” as well as “rock, paper, and scissors”, and initially, we'll have at
least five classes (healer, tank, dps, hybrid, crafter) per realm. For more on how the RPS
theory applies, please refer to Foundational Principle #6 </p>

<p>Mark Jacobs and Andrew Meggs founded City State
Entertainment in March 2011. CSE is a self-funded, independent game studio with
no venture capital and/or publisher ownership. In addition to the co-founders,
we have one of the earliest members of Mythic Entertainment, effects artist Mike Crossmire,who was a key
contributor to all of Mythic’s earliest games and <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i>, plus a young group of talented artists and
programmers, for some of whom this is their first industry gig. Mark has been
making games since the days of the Apple II, and while Andrew is a wee bit
younger, his credentials as a programming guru, graphics whiz and lead are
nothing short of outstanding; when your resume lists <i>Vampire: The Masquerade, Dark Age of Camelot, Warhammer, Skyrim</i> and
more, well, that’s quite a card deck. Together, these veterans have worked on more
than two dozen games spanning over 30 years in the industry.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-edit_url="/projects/13861848/camelot-unchained/assets/475397/edit" data-id="475397">

<p>Mark
Jacobs will add $2M dollars to the development budget himself. This is covered
in more detail below.</p>

</div>
<p>From his days at A.U.S.I. and at Mythic, Mark has preached
(sometimes to very deaf ears) the importance of talking with and listening to
the players. As part of our studio’s mandate, every developer at CSE will have a presence on our backer
forums. You want to praise, complain, question, probe, make suggestions, etc.
to them? You'll get your opportunity on our both community and moderated
private forums. </p>

<p>Every dollar we
raise from this Kickstarter campaign will go towards development. Our staffing
plan includes hiring three additional engineers, two artists, one designer and
one part-time writer immediately. The MMO engine will be developed in-house with
one purpose, to make a great RvR MMORPG; the engineers will work with Andrew on
it, and our existing programmers on the server tech. While this game won’t
require the amount of content as <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i>, we still need to
hire a few more artists in-house and a writer so, dragons be praised, Mark can
go back to his day job and stop writing all these documents.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-edit_url="/projects/13861848/camelot-unchained/assets/489352/edit" data-id="489352">

<p>Andrew has shown off some of the tech that he has been working on recently in his less-than-copious spare time.  Andrew has helped build in-house engines at Bethesda and Troika. He has also worked with the deepest innards of Source and Gamebryo and pushed the limits of Unity. He knows the technical challenges of putting together big open worlds, from content production through rendering, and there's nobody we'd rather have in that role. </p><div>

<p>Ask yourself
if any current MMORPG has delivered a long-lasting RvR experience. Would you like to help create that kind of
experience? Our backers will be part of
the creation process right from the beginning with our private forums and
access to the development team. What we
can do together over the next few years will set CSE and this project apart. Other developers talk about how much they
embrace the community (and some truly do) but Mark has been doing this for
almost 30 years, without fail. He hasn’t been afraid to talk with the players
and listen to their feedback, but he is also willing to say no. That approach is something everybody at CSE willingly
signs up for when it comes to communicating with our backers in order to make
this game a success.</p>

<p>Together, we
can create an RvR world that is more immersive, vibrant,
challenging and fun than anything we’ve seen in a long time. But we need your
help to do so. We hope you'll join us in
this great adventure, and we thank you for your interest in this project.</p>

The answer is yes, absolutely! We'll modify our reward tiers grid to make this as clear as possible today. Thanks - MJ</p>

<div class="divider clear"></div>
</h2>
<p><p>Making an MMORPG is hard; the vast landscape of MMO-Land is littered with the decaying corpses of many that even failed to launch, let alone to be commercially successful. While Mark Jacobs headed up a studio that launched two of the most highly rated (based on Metacritic) subscription-based MMORPGs of all time, this is no guarantee that we at CSE can accomplish what so many talented and more heavily financed teams have failed to do. So, instead of spending even more time here telling you why we can do better, Mark Jacobs is willing to do something quite unheard of on Kickstarter, which is to put $2M of his own money into this project, while at the same time not using any of the money raised from this Kickstarter to fund any part of his salary, perks, benefits, etc. </p>

<p>Mark has never been afraid of taking risks, and this is no exception. The money raised from our Kickstarter will be used to fund only a portion of the game’s development costs, and we have already lined up additional sums. These are dependent on us proving to the investors that there is a market for this type of game in today’s very difficult MMORPG climate. With a successful Kickstarter campaign, we`ll prove to them that we have a strong core group of people interested enough in this type of game to back it. Everyone recognizes how difficult it will be to pull this off (and the skepticism is sure to rival what Mythic Entertainment faced in 1999 after announcing Dark Age of Camelot).  By putting in $2M of his own money, Mark’s is showing our potential Kickstarter backers that he appreciates the risks you are taking and is willing once again to put his money where his mouth is.  Mark’s contribution to this Kickstarter project is more than any other developer he is aware of currently, even those whose financial success dwarfs his own. He believes in this project so much that he willing to risk a significant part of his savings just to make it come true. He will also have an additional update on this issue during the course of this Kickstarter.</p>

<p>How’s that for eliminating risk?</p>

<p>As to challenges, we will need to hire about a dozen talented artists, programmers and designers to round out the core team. Once we do that, the only other is whether a small, underfunded and undermanned team can pull off what almost all talented ones have failed to do in a generation - produce a great, long-lasting subscription-based MMORPG. Easy peasy lemon squeezy right?</p>

<p>Important Information About Our Pledge Rewards</p>

<p>- Must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian to visit the studio  </p>

<p>- Some rewards may require additional paperwork (to protect us and you) </p>

<p>- Creative endeavors such as an MMORPG are time-consuming processes, and as such, the dates listed above are, as the text indicates, just our best estimations for when the IT/Alpha/Beta tests will begin, not promises or guarantees.</p></p>

<div class="faq-answer">
<p>That depends if that other player is a backer. If so, you can freely share Founder’s Points but if that player wasn’t a backer, he wouldn’t be able to use them anyways since only backers have access to the Founder’s Exchange.</p>

</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>We can’t wait to support Paypal as we certainly want more backers for Camelot Unchained.Unfortunately, until Camelot Unchained reaches its funding goal we can’t because Paypal, unlike Kickstarter, charges people immediately and since the game hasn’t funded yet, we can’t add it to our Kickstarter page.</p>

<span class="question">Why have you chosen a subscription-model? Are you insane? Everything is FTP and should be now and forever!</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>a) Because I don’t want to have to support the vast majority of players who never pay for their time in FTP games; b) Maybe, but I think it is the good kind of insane; c) There’s a major shakeout coming down the road (3-5 years max) in the FTP space whether people/publishers want to hear it or not (well, it’s not of course). Besides, we will get a tighter community with fewer people who actually really want to play and stick with our game as opposed to a large number of people who are playing until they have to pay or they find a different FTP that interests them. </p>

</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>No, not at all. The Founder’s Exchange is a great way for our backers to customize their reward tiers. Once the “funding drive” for Camelot Unchained ends, backers will not be able to buy additional Founder’s Points. The FE will stay open to allow backers to redeem the points they received during the funding drive but we will not add the option to buy additional points.</p>

<span class="question">Are you really going to try to make an MMORPG for $2M?</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>No, even though Mark Jacobs made a pretty good one back in 2001 for only $2.5M, we don’t think you can make a great MMORPG for that amount of money today. That’s why Mark is putting in $2M of his own money plus an additional $1M from investors the moment this Kickstarter funds. Making a niche MMORPG for $5M, that’s an entirely different story but the $3M will only be invested if we raise the $2M from Kickstarter backers.</p>

<div class="faq-answer">
<p> Will there be a Linux or Mac version of this game? </p>

<p>  Because we are growing the engine in house, by the time it reaches adulthood it might not be an easy port to those operating systems. Andrew is going to dig deep down (he’s threatened to write assembly code again) to get us every ounce of speed he can get. That might prevent us from a quick and easy port. OTOH, we won’t know until we are much further along with the engine. </p>

<span class="question">Will there really be no PvE in the game at all? No NPCs, really?</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>There will be NPCs since towns need citizens, structures need guards, crafters need leather as well as other NPCs but they will not be dropping tokens, items, etc. However, you will be able to scavenge/skin/etc. materials from them only. There is also a difference between PvE-NPCs (cows) and RvR-NPCs (guards, human or otherwise). I also promise that there will not be PvE expansions with new tiers of gear drops that become required to complete. This game is a RvR-focused MMORPG and will remain such. </p>

<p>MY INN, MY WAY – PHYSICAL REWARDS
==============================  
With this non-repeatable, limited tier, PLEDGE OWNER receives THIS IS MINE! rewards and THESE UPGRADES: instead of a structure, pledge owner is assigned ONE OF THE INNS IN THE SAFE AREAS of the world + ONE OF EVERY ITEM IN THE FOUNDER’S EXCHANGE + an ADDITIONAL 100 FOUNDER’S POINTS (400 total) + RESERVED NAMING RIGHTS for a guild you start (unless the guild&#39;s name is trademarked/copyright by someone else) + TOTAL NUMBER OF BETA INVITES UPGRADED TO SIX + TOTAL NUMBER OF CHARACTER SLOTS UPGRADED BY SIX AT LAUNCH. Best of all, you will work with our team to both decorate and choose a tasteful name for an inn that is consistent with our game’s lore for within the realm of your choice. As the master of your own inn, you will be able to buy and resell food, drink, etc. but any currency that you hold cannot be shared with other players or even other characters of yours (sorry, but Mark insists, no game-balance altering items). Your inn will remain your property as long as the game is operating, even if the account goes inactive. As the owner of the inn you will not have to pay any rent on the property but you will be managing an inn and have to maintain a positive cash balance or you’ll have to make up the balance from your own in-game (we are not selling gold, ever!) currency reserves. Think of this as a simple inn simulator. While we guarantee that you’ll have a plot somewhere in your server of choice (based on when you backed this game), not all plots are created equal. Backers will be contacted based on when they pledged for Camelot Unchained and gave us their contact information. In addition, pledge owner receives SIX DIGITAL COPIES OF THE GAME (redeemable at the HERO LEVEL ONLY). This tier will not be available after release. Estimated delivery of Internal Testing Access: January 2014.</p>
