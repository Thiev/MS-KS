But reversing the spiral is the ultimate act of blasphemy.  Carrying the reflection of the holy name indicates a willingness to degrade and corrupt oneself in order to express contempt for all creation.  \\r\\nNow you, too, can express that contempt!

But if won&#39;t just be ANY story.  If you pledge $50+, you can dictate ONE element that must be present.  I&#39;ll limit that by saying no fanfiction, but stuff in my established settings -- eCollapse, Milonda, PROGENITOR -- are all fair game.  (I&#39;ll just have to hope and pray there&#39;s no crossover.)  Or maybe you want a love story.  Or a revenge drama.  Or for someone to get caught in flagrante delecto with the babysitter.
