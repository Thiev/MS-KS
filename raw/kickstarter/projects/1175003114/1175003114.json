You will have the attributes of a Kalder (a Jotnar champion who can transform into a Jorundimar) and as a Kalder you may outfit yourself with any of the three basic weapons (bow, spear and sword) plus one additional unique weapon of your choosing that we will model just for your Kalder (subject to approval). Your unique character will be fully modeled to the quality and specifications of other characters in the game, and you will also create the animations of the character as detailed in Augmented Animator. Destroying an opponent with an animated character model of yourself is surely the ultimate way to augment reality!",
