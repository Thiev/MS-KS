The type of loco and cars will be chosen by you from a selection of our highest quality stock. This trainset will be yours to do with as you please. You can share it with others for free or provide them for sale through the DLC store. You also receive all rewards up to SENIOR ENGINEER level plus your name in the credits listing the trainset and sponsored by you.

Receive all rewards up to and including SENIOR ENGINEER plus the unique opportunity to design your own special feature/function to be included in the final product. If you have a special need that doesn&#39;t fit in with the masses, or you would like to bring a feature to the top of the development queue, then this is the reward for you. We will discuss your idea with you, agree on a feasible project scope and devote 4 weeks of coding time to the task (plus additional testing and bug fixing as required). You will be involved at each stage of development from verifying the design specification through alpha implementation and beta testing. Your name and feature will be listed in the credits. You will also be granted access to the Trainz Pioneer Council.

</div><p>We've been busy working behind the scenes designing and creating an all new custom-built game engine, code-named "E2". This new engine will deliver a major upgrade in graphics capabilities and performance.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-edit_url="/projects/426668601/trainz-simulator-a-new-era-create-drive-operate-sh/assets/1227700/edit" data-id="1227700">

</div><p>E2 features the latest technology including HDR (High Dynamic Range) rendering, whole-world real-time per-pixel lighting, native multi-threading support, 64-bit processing support and unlimited seamless streaming.

With customized "graphics shaders" a huge new range of special effects will be possible such as reflective surfaces, heat haze effects, depth-of-field effects and atmospheric fog. </p><p>By offloading major systems to separate CPU cores and maximising performance, E2 will support additional physical effects. For example smoke will be affected by local wind conditions or hitting an overpass, and weather (rain, snow, even autumn leaves) that will collide against solid objects.</p><p><b>VIDEO: </b>Comparison of Trainz today and "tomorrow"</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-id="1319998">

</div><p>In railroad terms, a manifest is a list of cars in a mixed freight train. In terms of our four-track plan, the manifest is the list of features that we will be including in our 'Initial Goal' release. In other words, the feature set that we will deliver in December 2014 as a result of this Kickstarter project. </p><p>We have chosen a set of features that will provide a fantastic user experience, while keeping the scope of the project manageable (i.e. delivery within a year). 
</p><h1>DRIVING PHYSICS ENHANCEMENTS

</h1><p>From your feedback over the years, the most significant feature for many people is the accuracy of the simulation. This is why enhancements to the driving experience are at the very top of our T2 feature list.

</p><p>For the technically-minded, our physics model uses a variety of configurable inputs such as engine power, train weight and rolling resistance, then takes into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each car in the train. We then calculate the forces at work 30 times a second and as a result, the train accelerates or decelerates and moves along the track accordingly.</p><p>T2 introduces brand new Real-time Physics Editing tools enabling users to enter known specifications then accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted “on-the-fly”. By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-edit_url="/projects/426668601/trainz-simulator-a-new-era-create-drive-operate-sh/assets/1251652/edit" data-id="1251652">

</div><p>If physics aren't your thing, don't worry. You can leave the fine-tuning of your favourite loco performance to the experts and you will still have the choice of 'Realistic Mode' or 'Easy Mode' driving options.</p><h1>Initial Goal Features</h1><p>Of course Trainz is not all about driving and physics. As part of our Initial Goal Features, we will also be updating a large number of our existing systems as well as adding new tools and functionality. Continual improvement has been and always will be a big part of our development process.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-edit_url="/projects/426668601/trainz-simulator-a-new-era-create-drive-operate-sh/assets/1227486/edit" data-id="1227486">

</div><p>In addition to the new engine, new physics and a general system upgrade, we have sufficient time in our schedule to add two more major systems. By pledging at the Engineer Reward Level or higher you will earn a vote to help determine which two of the following four features will be included in our initial release. The remaining two features will then be moved to the top of our Stretch Goal list.</p><p><i><b>Update Dec 18th:</b> $190,000 target reached! The 3rd feature will be included at release. If we reach $215,000 prior to Pre-Beta release, all four of these features will be included at release. </i></p><p><i><b>Latecomers:</b> You can still pledge in 2014 through our <a href="http://anewera.trainzportal.com/Pages/TANE/status.html" target="_blank">online store</a>.</i></p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-edit_url="/projects/426668601/trainz-simulator-a-new-era-create-drive-operate-sh/assets/1227292/edit" data-id="1227292">

</div><p>Please note, we will also be releasing a feature-limited "Driver Edition" available through the Track Crew and Guard Reward Levels. This version is the same as the Full Version, excluding the Surveyor module. Surveyor includes all the world and session creation tools and physics editing tools.

</div><p>Trainz is a project which can be continually extended by adding new systems and updating existing features. As one new system is completed, another system becomes the next "must-have" feature. With the success of this Kickstarter project, we will be able to add the additional resources to ensure those systems are implemented sooner rather than later. </p><p>If our Initial Goal funding target is reached, we will then be ready for the even more exciting Stretch Goal phase. Every additional $50,000 raised will add new features into the schedule. By expanding the team and/or outsourcing we will be able to make the product even bigger and better and achieve all this sooner.</p><p><i><b>Update Dec 2nd:</b> Reaching $215,000 will result in the 3rd and 4th "Initial Goal" features being included at release. The next $50,000 milestone will result in the first from the following list of 25 features being added.</i></p><p>We have prepared the following list based upon your feedback and categorized the list into Stretch Goals of similar size and scope. The priority order of the Stretch Goal Feature Sets will then be determined in conjunction with the Trainz Pioneer Council and pledges from Senior Engineer Reward Level and above.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-edit_url="/projects/426668601/trainz-simulator-a-new-era-create-drive-operate-sh/assets/1319164/edit" data-id="1319164">

</h2>
<p><p>Trainz began development in 2000 and was first released in 2001. It is one of the longest continuously running game franchises and supports the world&#39;s biggest online train simulator community. We are a very experienced development team and understand project development processes, timelines and risks.</p>

<p>We have brought more than 15 different versions of Trainz to market on 5 different platforms. Trainz was one of the pioneering games for online sales, online communities, 3rd party content development, downloadable content, and even simulation apps for mobile, with Trainz Sim for iPad being released in 2010.</p>

<p>We have delayed launching our Kickstarter project until we could be reasonably confident of completing the project within a year. The core architecture of our engine is now substantially complete and this reduces the risk of delay. However, as with all software projects, there is still a risk as we implement new systems that unforeseen issues arise or that it takes longer to fix serious bugs than anticipated. We are also reliant on 3rd party content creators to provide a proportion of the content.</p>

<p>We pledge to keep our backers up to date on any issues we face and maintain an open and honest communication channel throughout the life of the project.</p></p>

</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>This version of Trainz is available only via digital download. It includes the Driver, Railyard and Content Manager modules but does not include the world/session building Surveyor module. There are options to upgrade the Driver Edition (separate purchase). You can add the Train Tab from Surveyor to make it available in Driver, so that you can assemble and place your own trains or you can add the full Surveyor module to allow you to edit or create routes and sessions.</p>

<span class="question">What DRM (Digital Rights Management) systems are used in Trainz; A New Era?</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>The boxed version of Trainz will be DRM free and will include a unique CD Key in the box. This version will operate without ever requesting to contact an online server to activate your product. 
<br />The digital download version will require a valid log-in to the store from which you purchased it.
<br />Official Payware DLC requires a log-in and online connection to download, then can be used offline. 
<br />Digital versions will require online authentication periodically (currently every month).
<br />3rd parties may offer non-DRM payware (e.g. .cdp or.exe installs)
<br />An internet connection and log-in are also required for Download Station Access, iTrainz Chat and Multiplayer.</p>

<span class="question">When does T2 require internet access?</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Trainz offers a number of internet-only features, including our Trainz Download Station which provides free access to a vast library of user-built content, iTrainz Chat and Multiplayer. These features require an internet connection while in use, and cannot operate while you are offline. For digital-download versions and for in-game payware support, T2 also requires occasional internet access to activate the purchased products. No persistent or always-on internet connection is required for this purpose.</p>

<span class="question">Which of my details are shared with N3V or others via the internet?</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>While connected to our online services, T2 will share the minimal amount of data required to undertake normal operation. This typically includes a secure handshake which authenticates your Planet Auran details (if you have entered Planet Auran details into the game), a digital shop receipt (if using Steam or some other third-party digital storefront), or a cookie which uniquely identifies your Trainz installation. You can avoid sharing this information by switching off the relevant services in the game settings.</p>

<p>If you are participating in anonymous usage statistics gathering, we also aggregate basic usage information which helps us to diagnose faults and improve the user experience. This data is not correlated back to a specific user.</p>

</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Yes. Both the boxed version and the digital download version can be used offline. The digital download version does require that you take the game online at least once per month in order to maintain your product activation - if you allow the activation to lapse then you simply need to go online again to reactivate. Of course, none of the online features of the game (including the Download Station, iTrainz Chat, and Multiplayer) will operate while you are offline. The boxed version can be used offline forever, if you so desire.</p>

<div class="faq-answer">
<p>You can prevent the game from accessing the internet by taking advantage of a fine-grained set of access controls available in the Trainz Settings. This includes the following options:</p>

<p>Disable all network access.
<br />Disable gathering of anonymous usage statistics.
<br />Disable access to iTrainz Chat and Multiplayer.
<br />Disable download station support. (Prevents refresh of content listings, prevents content download, hides existing content listings.)
<br />Disable the DRM system. (Only available for a boxed version which was registered with a CD Key. Disables all communication with the DRM server. Immediately disables all payware content and functionality.)</p>

<span class="question">What are the details of the Initial Goal Features?</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>A: Procedural Animated Spline Junctions </p>

<p>This feature includes underlying track system support and an updated set of track laying tools that will allow a user to lay track in Surveyor that automatically adds frogs (blades) and checkrails in the correct place on the tracks when making a junction. The blades will animate to indicate the direction of travel. Different switches (junction levers) can be placed to control the junction direction. </p>

<p>B: Super-Elevated Track + Improved Cab Sway + Train Motion </p>

<p>When laying track on curves, an angle modifier can be added to tilt the track in the direction of the curve. In addition, vehicle suspension will be modelled to accurately depict the angle of tilt (since this is dependent on speed and suspension). Using this suspension modelling system, cab sway and “car rocking” from both internal and external perspective will be implemented. When running on rough track, cars will wobble and shake independently.</p>

<p>C: Smoke and Weather Affected by World Objects </p>

<p>Collision volumes can be added to splines and map objects and the particle effects will then react to those collision volumes. Terrain will also support collision. This means rain will hit terrain or the roof of a station and splash, and smoke will hit the underside of a bridge or the top of a tunnel, change velocity and direction and flow out naturally.</p>

<p>D: Interlocking Towers / Track Blocks (UK: Signal Boxes)</p>

<p>Support will be added to allow the linking of signals and switches, and for a user to operate either mechanical levers (in older style towers) or console buttons (in newer towers) to adjust and lock a set. This will also provide a big helping hand to AI to “understand” the route better.</p>

<p>Q. What is an interlocking tower?</p>

<p>A. Some of the fundamental principles of interlocking include:
<br />Signals are locked in sets to prevent conflicting train movements to take place at the same time.
<br />Switches and other appliances in the route must be properly &#39;set&#39; (in position) before a signal may allow train movements to enter that route.</p>

<p>Once a route is set and a train is given a signal to proceed over that route, all switches and other movable appliances in the route are locked in position until either
<br />the train passes out of the portion of the route affected, or
<br />the signal to proceed is withdrawn and sufficient time has passed to ensure that a train approaching that route has had opportunity to come to a stop before passing the signal.</p>

<span class="question">How do Stretch Goals work?</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Once we pass our initial goal, each time we raise an additional $50,000, a new Stretch Goal is unlocked. The first two Stretch Goals will be the two Initial Goal Features that received the fewest votes, then we will move onto the full Stretch Goal list. </p>

<p>Update Dec 2nd: The two remaining features will now be combined into one Stretch Goal, with contributions towards the 2nd goal by way of ongoing pre-orders through the SimulatorCentral.com online store.</p>

<p>Prioritizing the Stretch Goal list will be done with the help of pledgers at Senior Engineer and above. After the Kickstarter Project is successful, completion surveys will be sent out in early January 2014.  Pledgers will vote for their favourite Stretch Goals and the feature with the highest number of votes becomes the highest priority, and so on.</p>

<span class="ss-icon ss-navigateright"></span>
<span class="question">What are the details of each of the Stretch Goal Feature Sets?</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Each of these Stretch Goal Feature Sets are designed to be approximately three man-months in duration for design, development and testing. The descriptions are purposely broad as each system needs to be fully designed and specced prior to development. We will be working with the Trainz Pioneer Council and others to finalize the details of the design, but these summaries will provide enough information for voting purposes.</p>

<p>1. Weather System Special Effects
<br />The types of features include:
<br />* Volumetric fogging
<br />* Rain-on-windshield effect
<br />* Wind effects
<br />* Weather zones
<br />* Moving / timed weather zones
<br />* Clouds / atmosphere
<br />* Heat-haze effects
<br />* Rain splashing on contact with all surfaces (ground/water/scenery objects/trains)
<br />* Snow / puddles accumulating on ground</p>

<p>2. Additional Physics Simulations 
<br />Additional braking systems including:
<br />* Vacuum brakes
<br />* EP brakes
<br />* Twin pipe air (brake distributor)</p>

<p>Additional power physics simulation:
<br />* Diesel mechanical transmission
<br />* Diesel Hydraulic transmission
<br />* AC electric sound
<br />* Diesel Fuel consumption
<br />* Oil fired steam fuel consumption</p>

<p>Additional steam support 
<br />* Smoke relates to power output/throttle settings (i.e. smoke is actually a reaction to engine effort)</p>

<p>3.Advanced Animated Passenger Loading
<br />Realistic passenger station movement and loading “simulation”.
<br />Players will select from libraries of high quality 3D passengers to place on stations, watch them animate, move, interact and get on and off the train. The level and sophistication of each of these aspects will be determined during design.</p>

<p>4. Advanced Animated Industries/Accessories:
<br />Bring your domestic/industrial and natural world to life with moving forklifts, cranes, animals, insects and leaves
<br />e.g. a container crane that moves along on it&#39;s rails to line up with the container to be removed from the train, lowers the crane into position, picks it up, moves it away, and places it down in a storage location. Then repeat for the next container, and so on. (No more fade-in, fade-out of loads.)</p>

<p>5.  Sun/Moon/Water System Enhancements:
<br />Regional, diurnal, zone based system improvements.
<br />Improved sun and moon visuals
<br />Improved sunrise/sunset/moonlight settings (and based upon latitude)
<br />New twilight mode
<br />Change in day length over the year
<br />Sloped and flowing water and new effects
<br />Snow-line setting</p>

<p>6. Ground Clutter and Texture System:
<br />Greater realism along trackside, and close to camera.
<br />Improved ground clutter + decals + tools to apply new effects
<br />Macro and micro detail ground textures for increased resolution/variation</p>

<p>7. Terrain Upgrade including Overhangs:
<br />Horizontal nudging of vertices - limited overhangs
<br />New cutting / embankment tools
<br />Dynamic billboards - mountains seen from any distance &quot;infinite draw distance&quot;
<br />Remove baseboard edging - stretch ground to infinity
<br />Support terrain higher than 5,000m</p>

<p>8. New World Building Tools:
<br />Landscape Genie - a configurable tool to auto-create and paint terrain and populate with selected objects
<br />Import DEM data directly with the Terrain Importer
<br />Google maps overlay or similar system</p>

<p>9. Prototypical Scheduling/Timetabling System
<br />Easy to use Passenger Schedule Creator in Surveyor
<br />Easy to follow Driver Schedule Performance Monitor in Driver
<br />Passenger comfort measure/feedback system</p>

<p>10. Prototypical Freight System
<br />Automatic creation of car waybills with destination information.
<br />Associated 3D world labelling and information
<br />Mini-map enhancements</p>

<p>11. Collision Physics and Destruction:
<br />Improved train collision and derailing physics 
<br />If one car bumps over wrong points, whole train doesn’t derail
<br />A car too close to junction will hit vehicle on nearby track and both will be derailed
<br />Collision/destruction of world objects: hitting cars at intersections will result in impact 
<br />(TBD what actually happens when objects collide)</p>

<p>12. AI System Upgrade plus User Tools
<br />Visualizing path for AI so user can follow the exact schedule/task for each AI Driver at any time and click to re-route or reschedule
<br />Receive dispatcher voice communication for signal state, and other traffic notifications
<br />Hotbox detectors (already supported - add something to highlight this?)
<br />Note: Depending on #9 and #10, some fundamental changes to AI systems to move towards prototypical work orders may be required.</p>

<p>13. Content Management + Localisation Tools
<br />Performance monitoring tools 
<br />3D model viewer
<br />Analyze and reduce content errors
<br />Drop in language files to localize game.</p>

<p>14. Ultra-High Res Screenshots + Video Mode
<br />Provide tools to create the best possible screenshots and videos
<br />Render at full details, higher resolution textures, full LOD on all assets, turn reflections up on all
<br />surfaces, increase scene density layer by layer, improve lighting (more single light sources)
<br />Additional trackside camera tools for better video capture (e.g. panning, zoom controls, override auto-distance, find &quot;next&quot; camera, list all cameras, show area of effect for cameras, even storyboarding to link camera movements)</p>

<p>15. Custom-built 3D sound system
<br />Current hardware for 3D sound provides a huge range of output. While some systems are very good, many sound cards result in poor 3D sound (such as all sound jumping from left to right speaker).
<br />By writing our own system in software, we can control the sound output, resulting in improvements to engine sound, track jointed rail, junction crossings etc.
<br />User configurable tools to improve sounds on a per-asset basis (fade-in/out, range control, repeat etc).</p>

<p>16. Additional Optimisations (Loading/Performance)
<br />Devote extra resources to improving performance across all aspects 
<br />Loading &amp; saving time
<br />Reduced memory consumption for large routes.
<br />Frame-rates in Driver and Surveyor
<br />Additional engine optimisations</p>

<p>17. Speedtree 6.0 (or 7.0) Update 
<br />Depending on the current version, update to v6 (current) ar v7 if it is available.
<br />Offers more variety, better quality, faster rendering, more realistic trees</p>

<p>18. Fulltime documentation + Content Creation Support
<br />Provide greater support to content creators and users. 
<br />Create additional tutorials to ensure the power of Trainz is enjoyed by more people.</p>

<p>19. GUI + HUD + Controls
<br />Surveyor UI overhaul
<br />Component GUI system for greater configurability of driver HUDs
<br />More control options:
<br />configurable multi-screen capabilities (multiple arbitrarily positioned monitors)
<br />Additional Controllers ( e.g. joystick, tablet, touchscreen)</p>

<p>20. Multiplayer and Social Options
<br />Additional/improved MP and social options including:
<br />Always on gameplay
<br />Improved networking performance
<br />Co-operative play
<br />Competitive play
<br />Improved chat system</p>

<p>21. Multi-platform Support
<br />Ports for Linux, Steambox, and maybe more (e.g. we may move Ocular Rift into here). 
<br />Note that Mac is now a guaranteed delivery item, with only the timing that may change. Please see the FAQ for Mac availability for more details.</p>

<p>22. Advanced Catenary Support + Advanced Loco Interiors
<br />Catenary height will raise/lower according to tunnels, crossing etc
<br />Pantograph will move up and down accordingly 
<br />Code support for additional in-cab items (valves, certain switch types)</p>

<p>23. Advanced Post-processing and Shader Effects
<br />Custom materials for every type of object and effect resulting in lots more eye candy. 
<br />Advanced shaders to make amazing effects happen
<br />e.g. chrome surfaces shine and reflect, ice glistens, dirt and weathering effects that change over time</p>

<p>24. AMD Mantle Support + Nvidia extensions + Oculus Rift support
<br />Reduce latency to video card for AMD cards allowing more objects on screen
<br />(especially animated objects)
<br />Oculus Rift support for full 3D visual effect (requires Oculus Rift hardware)</p>

<p>25. Extra One Month Polish
<br />Keep the whole team working for 30 more days on existing systems to improve, tweak, implement your suggested upgrades.</p>

<span class="question">What are the hardware specs?</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>The new engine is designed for current hardware, and will perform even better the higher the spec. </p>

<p>The key aspects to running T2 will be a graphics card that supports DX11, a 64 bit Operating System ( Win 7 or 8) and a quad core processor. (Dual core might be ok, but we won&#39;t be certain until things are optimized). </p>

<p>You can search on google to see if your hardware meets these requirements.</p>

<p>Remember also, that T2 will be released in a year from now and an $750 PC will be fine - that&#39;s $15 a week to save up for a shiny new PC.</p>

<p>Initially it will be PC only (Windows 7 and 8). There is a stretch goal listed to port to other hardware platforms which would result in a simultaneous release. Even without the stretch goal, we expect to port to Mac within 90 days of release and then Linux, SteamOS some time after that.</p>

<p>For mobile fans, we expect to have the new engine running versions of Trainz for tablets and smartphones in 2015.</p>

<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Name a Street and Street Sign: Add $20 to your pledge amount
<br />Simply tell us the words you would like on the sign, and we will create the asset for you. Depending on popularity, we may offer a choice of different signs to choose from (in your completion survey).</p>

<p>Name a Station or Industry: Add $50 to your pledge amount
<br />Similar to the street sign option, but based upon a selection of station and warehouse type assets. If you have a special request and we have an asset that matches, we will try to accommodate all requests. Please note that this item doe not include designing any new geometry, but rather naming a 3D model that you choose from the selection provided</p>

<p>Personalised 3D Avatar: Add $100 to your pledge amount
<br />An avatar is a model of a human with a likeness to a particular person. It has nothing to do with the movie Avatar :-) </p>

<p>As per the Inspector reward, you provide the photos, and we will create your own unique avatar. Your face will be wrapped onto one of 4 head shapes and attached to one of four body shapes. (We may offer more options if possible, depending on popularity). The avatar can then be added to station platforms, engine cabs or anywhere in the world using the Surveyor Editor Module. You can also choose to make the avatar private (i.e. only you get to see it) or public (anyone can see and place your avatar in game). </p>

<p>Reskinned Trainzcar: Add $125 to your pledge amount
<br />As per the Dispatcher Reward, work with our artists to customize your own unique piece of rolling stock in-game to immortalize your support for this project. You can choose from a selection of 10 cars that ship with the game (or even a container or billboard) and design a unique livery (paint job including logo and text) that our artists will apply for you. </p>

<p>Billboard Advertisement: Add $175 to your pledge amount
<br />Submit your own completed advertising image or submit a mock-up image with research material and we’ll create your very own billboard. You can choose from a variety of billboard options and dimensions like the example shown in the Update #10.</p>

<p>Scenery Item: Add $900 to your pledge amount
<br />As per the Stationmaster reward level, we will create a high resolution 3D scenery object specifically designed for you. The item can contain up to 10,000 polygons. As an indication, this would include items such as your house, your car, a bridge or perhaps a bunch of items found in a factory yard. You will need to provide research data, photographs etc for our artist to work from.</p>

<p>NOTE: When ordering these extra items, they do not come with the other rewards such as forum icons and beta access. </p>

<p>To gift someone a copy of the game PLUS a full set of rewards (e.g. TRAINZ CREW: Trainz : A New Era (Full) + Wallpapers + Forum Supporter Icon + Get-Trainz-Now Selection + Exclusive Beta Access) you need to create a second Kickstarter account on their behalf. To do this, log out of Kickstarter, register a new account with their email address. You can use the same credit card as for your personal account to create the second pledge and reward on their behalf.</p>

<span class="question">What is the difference between Collector and Trainz Collector</span>
</a>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>There are now two sizes of the Limited Edition Print. </p>

<p>For the Collector reward levels, we have created a new Limited Edition Print at 50cm x 30cm in size for just $95 more than the Senior Engineer reward. There will be 100 of these prints created. </p>

<p>The Trainz Collector reward offers the larger Limited Edition at 75cm x 45cm and there will be 50 of these prints created. We are unable to change the wording to adjust the size to the correct dimensions.</p>

<p>Both prints are created by high quality Giclee printing on premium grade artists canvas. The process uses Ultrachrome HD archival pigment inks and a professional ICC colour managed workflow.</p>

<p>The final image will be created once we have completed the Trainz: A New Era box art which will replace the placeholder image in the current preview. There will also be some further adjustments to the image to ensure the highest quality reproduction that you will be proud to hang in your home or office.</p>

<p>TRAINZ PIONEER COUNCIL: Trainz : A New Era (Full) + Wallpapers + Forum Supporter Icon + Get-Trainz-Now Selection + Alpha Access + Feature Vote + Stretch Goal Vote + Free DLC Pack + Pioneer Council Membership ______________________________ The Pioneer Council will not only help shape the future of Trainz, they will become part of the development process. Receive all rewards up to and including SENIOR ENGINEER, PLUS join us as a member of the exclusive 25 person Trainz Pioneer Council. Your name will go up in lights - literally. Each member of the Council will be provided their own 3D avatar which will feature in a unique &quot;showcase&quot; mini-route. This in-game &quot;demo scene&quot; will highlight the new features and special effects of E2/T2 and will be the base route for early testing and the NMRA show in October. More importantly, as a Pioneer Council Member you also gain access to the exclusive &quot;Pioneer Council&quot; design forums. Here you can read the design specs for each system, comment on them and discuss features (planned or proposed) with other members and with the Trainz team. In addition, you will also have access to alpha builds (under NDA) and be invited to a monthly Skype online meeting discussing the project status with the team and passing on your feedback. Your name will also be listed in the game credits. You may even want to hold a mini-election in your rail group/country/region to sponsor someone onto the council as your representative. We see this reward level as a pivotal role in the Kickstarter process. It will offer complete transparency to people outside the development team and will bring a new level of community involvement to Trainz. We&#39;ll also award you with a Trainz Forum &quot;Pioneer Council&quot; Status Icon.</p>
