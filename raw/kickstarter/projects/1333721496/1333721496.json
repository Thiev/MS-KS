Yes, it&#39;ll be your sheet music as the level, complete with us adding elements and obstacles onto the beat, and it&#39;ll be totally playable by everyone who gets the game! Now, it&#39;ll likely be a secret stage unlocked via a code you get upon beating the main game or something, but it&#39;ll certainly be in every copy of the game and can be unlocked normally. You&#39;ll be credited as the writer of the song and the stage can be named (mostly) whatever you like. Check our very first Update for more details and limitations. This tier also gets you all of the \"non-limited\" rewards; everything in Matthew&#39;s Tier: wallpaper, music, digital OST, digital Travel Guide, physical signed Guide, Baton Mini-Plush, the signed BitF hardcover, the sheet music bundle, the playable demo, and your name in the Backer Credits!
