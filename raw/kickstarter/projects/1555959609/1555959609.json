At this pledge level, you&#39;ll have access to everything but the actual assets and source code that make up the game. You&#39;ll be able to see the features and changes that I&#39;m experimenting with constantly. You will also be able to use the game in a debug like mode, I will leave that active.

Great detailed that I plan to make. These aren&#39;t just sitting on the potty, let me think of it now, I had multiple dozens of those.
