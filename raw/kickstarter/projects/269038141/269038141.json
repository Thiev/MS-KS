Alright, for single-handedly bringing this campaign 20% away from the goal, you can basically BECOME ME for a day. I will personally give you (to keep) my current favourite jeans, my current favourite shirt, and my ALL TIME favorite T-Shirt - the threadbare busted up Super Mario Bros T-Shirt my little bro gave me for my birthday in my 20&#39;s that is way too small for me but I keep for sentimental purposes. I will also prepare for you my favourite foods throughout the day (fluffernutters and bacon alllll day), provide an endless stream of gin martinis (with 3 jalepeno stuffed olives each) and teach you how to do every little thing I do on a day to day basis from how make drawings, games and music to the specific way I upload files via FTP and even down to the way I sneeze while holding my lower back so as to minimize the laser-like pains that shoot through my legs due to spending so much goddamn time in a computer chair.\\r\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\r\\nThe real reward is that you will go back into your life feeling a fuller and more complete human being knowing that anything you do for the rest of your life from that point onwards is more meaningful and rich because of the 24 hours of depravity you experienced on that &#39;dark day&#39;. Plus you can help me design a playable / unlockable character for the game, an enemy for the game AND your own planet in the game. I&#39;ll even list you in the credits right next to my name.\\r\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\r\\nI will not cover travel expenses, but I can promise you will be treated as well as I have ever experienced in my lifetime.\\r\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\r\\nAlso, the tree thing.\\r\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\r\\nPS. this is a joke\\r\\nPPS. that said, i am actually legally bound to provide these wonders if you actually pledged 8 grand. So... Just sayin.",
