The Uzebox is a completely open source console that competes with NES as far as horsepower goes. I&#39;ll be releasing a rom for it that will only feature an Arcade mode that pits the player in an endless swarm of enemies. It will have similar qualities to the main game that this project is for but it will be decidedly more primitive since once again it&#39;s going to be on an NES like system. It will have a mock history and lots of humor involved in its&#39; presentation. If I can legally do so, I will include as many Uzebox roms as possible in the shipment of the device to anyone that pledges at this level. At the very least you can download them for free. I don&#39;t know of a single rom that&#39;s protected against free distribution but I will confirm this before shipping them out. Each Uzebox will come with 2 NES controllers and either a mini-disc or flash drive that has a back up of all of the roms on the system along with the the pc emulator and source code for the basic rom I&#39;m creating and each pledgers customized rom file. This reward may take longer than all of the others to arrive due to availability of the system along with the extra time needed to develop the game. I&#39;m already developing for multiple platforms but this one will require completely unique source code and cannot be started until the original game has become stable and is close to completion.",
