It is his family (Sacagawea and their son, Jean Baptiste) that helps Native American tribes see the Corps of Discovery less as a military outfit and more as a band of peaceful explorers.

Cruzatte, who definitely had poor vision and may even have been blind in one eye, probably mistook Lewis for a tasty elk or somesuch while they were out hunting (Lewis was dressed in buckskin). The bullet hit Lewis through his \"left hip-joint,\" then \"cut the thickness of the bullet across the hinder part of the right thye [sic].\" In other words, both buttocks with one bullet. Awesome.

He hired Lewis as his personal secretary and trained him in scientific classification, cryptography, and many other skills essential to the voyage. In MERIWETHER, Jefferson is the first person Lewis speaks to in the game. That means he is also the first NPC players can click on and see the generosity of this level&#39;s backer extolled in  the Wunderkammer (and also in the credits).

In every way, the two men shared command. That may sound like a formula for disaster, but the amazing success of the Expedition speaks to the remarkable character of both men. In many ways, Clark was the work-horse of the Corps, the reliable and constant soldier who would endure any hardship for his country and his fellow soldiers. He was also the Corps&#39; cartographer and the man we have to thank for the amazingly accurate maps he created on the voyage. Narratively, Clark is a lynchpin of MERIWETHER, the character to whom you will speak most often.

Captain Lewis had an embarrassment of talents: athletic, courageous, and a dead-eye marksman, he was the soldier you wanted standing next to you in a fight. But he was also keenly intelligent, equally adept in the sciences as in the arts. He is one of the United States&#39; earliest naturalists, recording literally hundreds of plant and animal species new to Western science. At the same time, he expresses himself in his journals with a brio that would be the envy of any poet. It is this American original who serves as the centerpiece and vehicle for MERIWETHER.
