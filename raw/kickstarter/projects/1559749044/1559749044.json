NOTE, the KID POWER ULTIMATE RARE Promo Chip is the one in the video and is not the chip in the main image at the top of the page. IN ADDITION, ALL BACKERS will receive the Kid Power Promo Chip as a special thank you for backing us early on! PLUS, CHECK OUT our REWARD UPDATE CENTRAL for the latest giveaways for all Kickstarter Backers! AND ONE FINAL NOTE - REMEMBER all our physical chip games (Knockout, Super, and Ultimate) will be converted to multi-player online 3D games similar to what you see at PKR.com. So plan on seeing your Simulist Avatar controlling your digital chips in 3D and the sleek Player Management System (as seen in the video) is where you&#39;ll buy, collect and manage all your chips in 2D. Just to clarify! That said, everything we have done is currently in 2D, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re here on Kickstarter to be able to complete the \"3D Winner-Take-All Digital Chip Games\" played in futuristically themed game rooms. Won&#39;t you join us! Make your Pre-Order today and follow us every step of the way in 2012.",
