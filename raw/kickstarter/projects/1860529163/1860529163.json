One of London&#39;s most famous buildings, especially since being used on the Pink Floyd &#39;Animals&#39; album cover. See inside the Power Station in areas that aren&#39;t open to the public and have a chat about how working on Events at this inspirational venue helped shape the App! The tour will last up to 1 1/2hrs, it will be for you and a friend, you must make your own travel arrangements to Battersea, London. Almost any day/time can be accommodated, but it must be done before the end of April 2013 as the place is being developed and you will never get the chance again to see it in it&#39;s original state. Have a look at pictures of this incredible place on my work&#39;s website www.industri.uk.com",
