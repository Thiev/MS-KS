During the meal, we will chat and small talk, and discuss the game or whatever you feel like talking about.  Afterwards, you will help me design a part of the game.  This will be designing a more in-depth Private Island than in the other reward tier, we will work together to pick a location, design the Exterior Cell, design a settlement on the island, and design a dungeon on the island.  I will also let you choose a style of statue to dedicate to yourself and help choose a place to put it.  You will also help me create an NPC near that statue with basic greetings you help write.  IMPORTANT!!!: You are responsible for your own travel.  I am located in Southern Indiana, near New Albany.  If you are within driving distance, great!  If you have to fly, I will be happy to pick you up at Louisville International Airport in Louisville KY right across the river, that is the closest airport.  Plan for a 2 day visit, I will help you locate lodging nearby.  I will pay for or prepare Lunch or Dinner once each of the 2 days you are here, and we will spend about 5 hours (maybe more if we really get into it and have the energy!) each day working on the details of your additions to the game.  I will also mail you a USB drive containing the final game, the artwork, and a few other goodies when the game is completed.  I will also be in touch with you during development as much as needed to make sure your Private Island is completed if we don&#39;t get it done during your visit.  If you are unable to arrange a visit, we will communicate as much as needed to get your Island done the way you like, including sending you exclusive builds of the game while I am working on your island so you can give feedback during it&#39;s creation, and I&#39;ll send you a $100 giftcard for a restaurant of your choice (that I have access to gift cards for) to make up for not being able to have lunch with me, but I really hope if you pledge this tier that you can make the trip!",
