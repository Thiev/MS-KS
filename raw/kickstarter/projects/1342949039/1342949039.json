You share a hotel room with me and 2-3 others in my Gen Con crew (most likely my poster/t-shirt printing specialist and my blue Twi&#39;lek \"booth babe\"), and you party like a game designer (see below) for five glorious nights. The only thing you need is spending money for food and shopping; we&#39;ll even pick you up at the airport!\\r\\n\\r\\nACCOMMODATIONS: We are staying in the Marriott Downtown Indianapolis, directly across the street from the exhibit hall at the convention center (and we even have an elevated skywalk that connects us so we don&#39;t even have to cross the street!). Keep in mind, though, you&#39;ll be attending the convention the same way we do: Cramming as many people as possible into each hotel room. I will give the owner of the VIP package the option to pick a bed all their own, though, and I hereby volunteer to sleep on the air mattress if no one else will!  \\r\\n\\r\\nFLIGHT: As mentioned, the offer is limited to the lower 48 US states just to keep the costs reasonable -- Alaska, Hawaii, and most international flights would cost an arm and a leg. If you&#39;re really, really interested and you&#39;re coming from farther away, I would chip in the first $300 of the ticket if you&#39;re willing to spring for the rest. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"PARTYING LIKE A GAME DESIGNER\": Game designers don&#39;t party very well (we&#39;re all socially awkward nerds), but we are prone to playing pick-up games at night in the hotel room. (And drinking. We do tend to drink.)",
