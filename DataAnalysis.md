Steps in a data analysis
------------------------
1. Deﬁne the question

-  Do past Kickstarter projects' successes/failures influence future successes/ 
failures Kickstarter projects?

- (more generic) predicting of Kickstarter project success

2. Deﬁne the ideal data set

3. Determine what data you can access

- Kickstarter (projects+videos+webpages, aggregates about backers and funds, 
  backers (+facebok link)), 

- Kicktraq (daily numbers: backers, funds), 

- Facebook (for network analysis of backers and project fanpages), 

- Youtube (for associated videos: comments, number of views)

4. Obtain the data

All ***Video Game*** finished projects are in scope: successful, unsuccessful and cancelled. We shall navigate to a corresponding result page using Kickstarter. Due to pagination, we have to download page by page. The last page will have no results.
